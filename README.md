# Dotfiles

My repo for tracking some of my customisation to my linux laptops/desktops.


## i3-gaps
Application switcher: Rofi
Screen locker: i3lock-fancy https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy 

## .Xresources
Theme for Rofi. 

## .bashrc
messy file.

adds:
 - cool ps1 terminal prompt colours
 - current git branch
 - few aliases (python calculator, i3 edit)

## .conkyrc
may or may not work, minimal clock.

__(works on i3, not unity??)__

## bin/

 - ./setbrightness.sh - set brightness of screen. see http://ttrmw.co.uk/linux/hardware_button_brightness.html
 - ./lock_screen.sh - call i3lock-fancy (see above)
