# Dotfiles

My repo for tracking some of my customisation to my linux laptops/desktops.

- Desktop: Manjaro 17.06
- Laptop: Manjaro 17.06
- Tablet: Windows + Linux subsystem
- Colorscheme of the moment: gruvbox dark.


## Vimrc
basic vimrc file with a few enhancements to make vim not so shit

## i3-gaps
Application switcher: Rofi (gruvbox theme, using latest theme engine)

config uses vim bindings for i3 personalised to how I like it:
 - split h is | and split v is - or v
 - scratchpad uses the equals key in place of the minus key (Might not work, never used it. Just changed because of conflict)
 - manjaro help (formerly mod+shift+h) is now mod+shift+/

## .Xresources
Theme for Rofi and urxvt.

## .zshrc
using oh-my-zsh with some random prompt that looked cool.
few aliases in there.


## .bashrc
messy file. Not used anymore 

adds:
 - cool ps1 terminal prompt colours
 - current git branch
 - few aliases (python calculator, i3 edit)

## .conkyrc
may or may not work, minimal clock. Not used currently. 

## bin/

 - ./setbrightness.sh - set brightness of screen. see http://ttrmw.co.uk/linux/hardware_button_brightness.html
